        DevOps_Assignment2: - DockerFile - Build image with loaded MYSQL schema
Steps to solve this Assignment: -

1. Pull the latest code i.e; Open terminal & type following command: -

   git clone https://github.com/JosnaTitus/DevOps_Assignment2.git
  
2. Go to cloned repo-directory and Build image using command: -

   cd DevOps_Assignment2
  
   docker build . -t Assign2
   
3. Start the container using command: -

   docker run --name Devops_assignment2 -p 1020:1020 -d Assign2
   
4. Connect to MYSQL using a bash shell using command: -

   docker exec -it Devops_assignment2 /bin/bash
   
5. It will take you to the root, then start MYSQL with Username = pucsd and Password = pucsd using command: -

  mysql -upucsd -ppucsd
  
6. After successful connection with MYSQL we can see Database = pucsdStudents and Table = studentData and we can get whole data using command: -

•	Use pucsdStudents;

•	Select * from studentData;

Explanation of DockerFile and its instructions: -

FROM mysql:latest 

ENV MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD 123 

ENV MYSQL_DATABASE pucsdStudents 

ENV MYSQL_USER pucsd 

ENV MYSQL_PASSWORD pucsd 

ADD test.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d 

EXPOSE 1020
First, we will be using mysql image with its latest version. So ‘’FROM mysql:latest” command will pull the mysql image latest version. Then we will specify some Environment variables as we have to use them while creating mysql account. So, we will specify environment variables as mysql root password, mysql database name, mysql username, mysql password.

Now we can directly connect to Database pucsdStudents but here we have to import some data in it. So i have created a sql file as test.sql to import data from it. According to MySQL container documentation if we want to execute a file at beginning then we will write command “ADD” following file name which is to be imported, and by default this file should be added to specific directory called “docker-entrypoint-initdb.d ”. sql file should be at same directory of Dockerfile.

Now we have to add port mapping with instruction “EXPOSE “and port no. as 1020.
